# tree-sitter-zig

[tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) parser inspired by and partially built on [maxxnino/tree-sitter-zig](https://github.com/maxxnino/tree-sitter-zig) that's made to be simple to query and structure-preserving on error rather than 100% adherent to the Zig spec.
